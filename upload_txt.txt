Machine learning training models:
Linear Regression: Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable and aims to minimize the residual sum of squares.

Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by introducing polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships between variables. This allows for more flexible modeling of complex data patterns.

Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the error or loss function in machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function gradient until convergence is achieved.

Learning Curves: Learning curves provide valuable insights into a model's performance by plotting the training and validation error as a function of the training set size. They help diagnose issues such as overfitting or underfitting and guide decisions on model complexity and dataset size.

Regularized Linear Models: Regularization techniques such as L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization are used to prevent overfitting in linear models by adding penalty terms to the loss function. They encourage simpler models by penalizing large coefficient values.

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used for binary and multiclass classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using the logistic function, which maps the input space onto a probability scale.
